Radius definitions
####################

Because of its complex shapes, there are several ways to define the size of an aggregate. We will use two definitions: (i) the volume-equivalent radius :math:`a_\mathrm{V}` and (ii) the characteristic radius :math:`a_\mathrm{c}`. The former and latter definitions are, so-to-speak, measuring the mass and the apparent size of an aggregate, respectively.

The volume-equivalent radius is the radius of a sphere formed by squashing an aggregate into a sphere with the same volume as the original aggregate. Since the volume of the dust particle is the same before and after the squashing process, we have

.. math::
   \frac{4}{3}\pi a_\mathrm{V}^3=N \frac{4}{3}\pi a_\mathrm{mon}^3,

where :math:`a_\mathrm{mon}` is the radius of a monomer and :math:`N` is the number of monomers. We have also assumed all monomers in the aggregate are idential and spherical. From this, we obtain 

.. math::
   a_\mathrm{V}=a_\mathrm{mon}N^{1/3},


The volume-equivalent radius may be regarded as a measure of the aggregate volume (or its mass). It is obvious however that an actual aggregate could have a size much larger than the volume-equivalent radius, particularly when the porosity is high. Thus, we introduce the second definition for the aggregate radius: the characteristic radius :math:`a_\mathrm{c}` (Mukai et al. 1992, Kozasa et al. 1992):

.. math::
   a_\mathrm{c} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}a_\mathrm{g},

where :math:`a_\mathrm{g}` is the radius of gyration defined by

.. math::
    a_\mathrm{g} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{ \\|\vec{r_i}-\vec{r_\mathrm{M}}\\|^2 }{N}},

.. .. math::
    a_\mathrm{g} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{ \|\vec{r_i}-\vec{r_M}\|^2 }{N}}

where :math:`\vec{r_i}` is the position vector of :math:`i`-th monomer, and :math:`\vec{r_\mathrm{M}}` is the position vector of the center of mass of the aggregate. The radius of gyration therefore represents a standard deviation of a distance between each monomer and the center of mass.

Fractal dimension, prefactor, and porosity
##########################################

By using the above two radius definitions, we define the porosity of an aggregate by

.. math::
   \mathcal{P} = 1 - \left(\frac{a_\mathrm{V}}{a_\mathrm{c}}\right)^3.

Since both :math:`a_\mathrm{c}` and :math:`a_\mathrm{V}` are proportional to the monomoer radius, the porosity is independent of the monomer radius.

It is also useful to intorudce the fractal dimension :math:`D_\mathrm{f}` defined as follows:

.. math::
   N = k_\mathrm{f}\left(\frac{a_\mathrm{g}}{a_\mathrm{mon}}\right)^{D_\mathrm{f}},

where :math:`k_\mathrm{f}` is the fractal prefactor. 


The fractal dimension is a quantity that characterizes the geometric shape of an aggregate. 
For example, an aggregate with a fractal dimension of 3 has monomers distributed in such a way that the aggregate's mass grows with the cube of its radius of gyration, similar to an elementary scaling for a single spherical particle. In this case, the aggregate tend to have compact structure. A fractal dimension may also be less than 3, with lower values corresponding to more open aggregate structures. For example, an aggregate consisting of monomers lined up in a straight chain would have a volume proportional to its radius, resulting in a fractal dimension of 1.

The  fractal prefactor :math:`k_\mathrm{f}` may be regarded as related to a packing fraction in :math:`D_\mathrm{f}` dimensional space. Its meaning becomes clear if we consider the case of :math:`D_\mathrm{f}=3`. In this case, the above fractal scaling law gives 

.. math::
   \left(\frac{a_\mathrm{V}}{a_\mathrm{c}}\right)^3=\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{3/2}k_\mathrm{f}\approx0.465 k_\mathrm{f} ~~(D_\mathrm{f}=3)


By substituting this expression into the definition of the porosity, we obtain

.. math::
   \mathcal{P}=1-0.465 k_\mathrm{f}~~(D_\mathrm{f}=3)

Therefore, the fractal prefactor is related to the porosity of an aggregate.

Definitions of scattering properties
#####################################

Notations
**************
The definition of the optical properties written in a file ``dustkapscatmat_XXX.inp`` follows the definitions of the ones used in RADMC-3D (see also `the manual of RADMC-3D <https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/manual_radmc3d/dustradtrans.html#polarization-stokes-vectors-and-full-phase-functions>`_).

Suppose we observe scattered light from a collection of *identical* dust particles and the dust particles are randomly orientated with equal probability, then the scattering matrix, which relate incident and scattered Stokes parameters, will have 6 independent elements:

.. math::
    \begin{pmatrix}
    I_\mathrm{sca} \\ 
    Q_\mathrm{sca} \\
    U_\mathrm{sca} \\
    V_\mathrm{sca} \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \frac{m_\mathrm{dust}}{d^2}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    Z_{11} & Z_{12} & 0 & 0 \\
    Z_{12} & Z_{22} & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & Z_{33} & Z_{34} \\
    0 & 0 & -Z_{34} & Z_{44} \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    I_\mathrm{inc} \\ 
    Q_\mathrm{inc} \\
    U_\mathrm{inc} \\
    V_\mathrm{inc} \\
    \end{pmatrix},

where :math:`d` is the distance from a dust particle to the observer, :math:`m_\mathrm{dust}` is the mass of a dust particle (:math:`\mathrm{g}`), :math:`Z_{ij}` is scattering matrix elements. If each dust particle is not spherically symmetric, we have :math:`Z_{11}\neq Z_{22}` and :math:`Z_{33}\neq Z_{44}`.

The scattering matrix elements :math:`Z_{ij}` (:math:`\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{str}`) are related to the traditional notation via: 

.. math::
    Z_{ij}=\frac{S_{ij}^\mathrm{BohrenHuffman}}{k^2m_\mathrm{dust}},

where :math:`k` is the wave number (:math:`\mathrm{cm}^{-1}`), and :math:`S_{ij}` are the scattering matrix elements defined by `Bohren & Huffman (1983) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983asls.book.....B>`_. 
Note that RADMC-3D adopts the IAU 1974 definition for the Stokes vectors, and it is different from what Bohren & Huffman's book follows. As a result, we need a minus sign for the :math:`Z_{13}`, :math:`Z_{14}`, :math:`Z_{23}`, :math:`Z_{24}`, :math:`Z_{31}`, :math:`Z_{41}`, :math:`Z_{32}`, :math:`Z_{42}` elements because of the opposite :math:`U` and :math:`V` sign conventions (But, these elements are zero for our cases).

The integration of :math:`Z_{11}` over the all solid angles gives the scattering opacity (:math:`\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}`)

.. math::
    \kappa_\mathrm{sca}(\lambda)=\int_{4\pi} Z_{11}(\theta,\lambda)d\Omega.

The definition of the *phase function* is the same as Bohren & Huffman's one (see Eq. 13.3 in Chapter 13):

.. math::
   p(\theta)\equiv\frac{1}{C_\mathrm{sca}}\frac{dC_\mathrm{sca}}{d\Omega}=\frac{1}{C_\mathrm{sca}/m_\mathrm{dust}}\frac{S_{11}}{k^2m_\mathrm{dust}}=\frac{Z_{11}(\theta)}{\kappa_\mathrm{sca}},

where :math:`C_\mathrm{sca}` is the scattering cross section, and :math:`dC_\mathrm{sca}/d\Omega` is the differential scattering cross section. The phase function is therefore normalized such that :math:`\int_{4\pi} p(\theta)d\Omega=1`. The asymmetry parameter is defined by (p. 72, Section 3.4 in Bohren & Huffman's book):

.. math::
   g \equiv \int_{4\pi} p(\theta) \cos\theta d\Omega=\frac{2\pi}{\kappa_\mathrm{sca}}\int_{-1}^{+1} Z_{11}(\mu)\mu d\mu,

where :math:`\mu=\cos\theta`; :math:`\theta` is the scattering angle (:math:`\theta=0^\circ` is the forward scattering direction). :math:`g` is a non-dimensional quantity.

Size distribution averaging
****************************

This package provides the optical properties averaged over a particle-size distribution. The size distribution is assumed to obey a power-law function:

.. math::
   n(a_\mathrm{V})da_\mathrm{V}\propto a_\mathrm{V}^{-q}da_\mathrm{V}~(a_\mathrm{min}\le a_\mathrm{V}\le a_\mathrm{max}),

where :math:`a_\mathrm{V}` is the volume-equilvanet radius of a dust particle, and :math:`n(a_\mathrm{V})da_\mathrm{V}` is the number density of particles within [:math:`a_\mathrm{V},a_\mathrm{V}+da_\mathrm{V}`]. By default, we adopt :math:`q=3.5`.

The average scattering matrix elements for a collection of various particle sizes can be expressed as the following integration:

.. math::
   Z_{ij,\mathrm{ave}}(\theta)=\frac{\int_{a_\mathrm{min}}^{a_\mathrm{max}}a_\mathrm{V}^{3-q}Z_{ij}(a_\mathrm{V},\theta) da_\mathrm{V}}{\int_{a_\mathrm{min}}^{a_\mathrm{max}} a_\mathrm{V}^{3-q}da_\mathrm{V}},

where :math:`Z_{ij,\mathrm{ave}}` are the scattering matrix elements averaged over the size distribution (Remember that :math:`Z_{ij}` are quantities per unit mass). Similarly, the distribution-averaged absorption opacity is calculated by 

.. math::
    \kappa_\mathrm{abs,ave} = \frac{\int_{a_\mathrm{min}}^{a_\mathrm{max}}a_\mathrm{V}^{3-q}\kappa_\mathrm{abs}(a_\mathrm{V}) da_\mathrm{V}}{\int_{a_\mathrm{min}}^{a_\mathrm{max}} a_\mathrm{V}^{3-q}da_\mathrm{V}}.

The averaged scattering opacity and asymmetry parameter are calculated from the averaged value of :math:`Z_{11,\mathrm{ave}}`:

.. math::
    \kappa_\mathrm{sca,ave}=2\pi \int_{-1}^{+1} Z_{11,\mathrm{ave}}(\mu)d\mu,\\
   g_\mathrm{ave}=\frac{2\pi}{\kappa_\mathrm{sca,ave}}\int_{-1}^{+1} Z_{11,\mathrm{ave}}(\mu)\mu d\mu.
