What's AggScatVIR?
=====================

``AggScatVIR`` provides the optical properties of protoplanetary dust analogs at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. One can freely download the scattering matrix and opacity of various dust particles studied in Tazaki & Dominik (2022) and Tazaki, Ginski, and Dominik (in prep).

######################

* **Based on rigorous light scattering solvers**: We have used rigorous numerical techniques to calculate the optical properties of complex-shaped particles, such as the T-matrix method (used for aggregates) and discrete dipole approximation (used for irregular grains). 
* **A extensive parameter-space coverage**: We have tried to cover a wide variety of dust morphology, such as aggregate radius, monomer radius, composition, porosity, and fractal dimension. The database consists of 360 different dust models; 20 irregular grain models (10 grain radii; 2 compositions), 126 different compact aggregate models (3 aggregation models; 2 compositions; 3 monomer radii; on average 7 aggregate radii), and 214 fractal aggregate models (4 different fractal dimensions, 2 compositions, 5 monomer radii; on average 5.35 aggregate radii).

* **Full compatibility with RADMC-3D v2.0**: One key application of AggScatVIR is observational modeling of (un)polarized scattered light from protoplanetary disks and debris disks. For this purpose, each file provided in this database has a data structure directly readable by a public radiative transfer code `RADMC-3D v2.0 <https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/>`_

Assumptions and Limitations
############################
Since we adopt exact numerical techniques for solving the optical properties, the limitation is coming from simulation setups.


* **Randomly orientated particles**: Since each dust particle is no longer spherically symmetric, we need to assume an orientation of a particle with respect to the incident and scattered light directions. We assume that the particles are randomly orientated, and then their optical properties are averaged over all possible orientations with an equal probability. In other words, we *do not* consider the situation where non-spherical particles get aligned. Because of this assumption, only six elements (out of 4x4=16 elements) of the scattering matrix are independent.

* **Monomers are homogeneous spheres with a single size**: This assumption is mainly for computational convenience. However, the monomers of cometary aggregates in the Solar System have been suggested to have a log-normal size distribution with a mean value of a sub-micrometer size (Rietmeijer 1993). As long as aggregates are cometary-like, our optical properties would not be far too different from the actual optical properties.
